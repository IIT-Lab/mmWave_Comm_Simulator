# mmWave_Dev -- Daily dev branch -- will push if tested fully

# Pending tasks

* Channel: built-in profile (3GPP TR38.901 CDL-C/D) vs custimized (perhaps from Rapapport?)

* Multiple receiver elements? i.e., MIMO?

* Multi User -- Y(received) = Sum(amplitude * U1 + amplitude * U2 + ...) for U1

* Radiator for customized URA -- self-implement (most likely)

* Small questions regarding 3GPP TR38.901

    * *Pathloss* -- which model? Phased Transmitter + Receiver (pre-amp + post-amp noise etc modeling)

    * Large-scale shadowing?

    * LoS probability?

    * Mobility (Doppler shift only)
